On monday Sam go to cs400 class and take note on the outline during the class.  He tried his best to pay attention but found class to be very boring.  Unfortunately class didn't end for another 20 minutes so Sam tried to think of something more interesting to do. He found that even just fidgeting with his pencil was more entertaining than paying attention.
